Spam traps are email addresses that should not be on any marketer’s list. They are implemented and monitored by ISPs, Blacklists, and other third-party actors like Cloudmark in an effort to identify spammers and senders who engage in abusive practices like scraping and generating lists. The blacklists and ISPs guard access to their spam trap networks closely and regularly create new ones in an effort to foil the detection that would allow a sender to remove spam traps from their list.
Spam traps can be grouped into three categories:

### Typo
These are domain addresses that have been misspelled, such as Gmall or Comnast.  Typo traps are the most common spam traps, as they are considered to have been “fat-fingered” by the user when entering in their email address. 

While it is expected that a sender will hit some typo traps due to user error when submitting their address, hitting a Typo Trap more than once tells the ISP that the sender is not using confirmed/double opt-in practices, as if they were, they would suppress the trap address after it failed to confirm the opt-in email.

Another possible source of Typo traps is bot attacks on form fields. If an ISP sees a sudden flood of Typo traps they may assume that the sender has suffered a bot attack and consider that if the sender is using insecure practices on their forms, they may also use other insecure practices that put the ISP’s customers at risk.

### Grey (Recycled) 
These are addresses that, although they were once active - have been out of use for a certain period of time. ISPs take inactive addresses that should have bounced over that period of time, and reactivate the accounts.  

If a recycled address receives an email, ISPs know that the list is either purchased, received from an affiliate, or is not being segmented by engagement.  Engagement with their users is the primary metric for a sender’s reputation with any ISP, and ISPs take these traps very seriously.

### Pristine  
Pristine spam traps are real email addresses that have never opted into any email communications. The email address may have been placed on a blog, forum, or chat room, but has never signed up for any form of email communication. Additionally, ISPs will monitor purchased lists through subtle tactics or simply through purchasing the lists themselves. If these lists contain nonexistent email addresses, such as generated addresses, ISPs will often create those email accounts as Pristine spam traps in order to identify any sender who has purchased that list.
